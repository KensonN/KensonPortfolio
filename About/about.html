                I am Kenson Nguyen. My current residence is in San Jose, California. where I attend Summit Rainier High School as a tenth grader. I was born and raised in San Jose, and have never moved. Throughout my life, I have been to some new and interesting places. For example, one year, my family and I travled to the East Coast, where we visited New York, Boston, and Canada. In addition to lots of traveling, I have also been a Boy Scout for 7 years. I joined as a Wolf Cub Scout and am now a Boy Scout, with the rank of Star.

                One of my favorite things to do is to go and play video games. Right now, my favorite video game is Counter Strike: Global Offensive. In this game, you play as either the Terrorist or Counter-Terrorist team. As a Terrorist, you need to plant the bomb and defend it. As a Counter-Terrorist, you need to stop the Terrorist team from planting the bomb or defuse it. Another one of my favorite activites is reading. My favorite book series to date is The Giver Quartet. This series explores a Dystopian future where technology has advanced and society has drastically changed.

                Like I said before, one of my hobbies is playing video games. Since CS:GO is my favorite game right now, I play it the most. In the game, although I'm not very good compared to everyone, I am good enough to beat my friends, like William Ivanov. Another one of my hobbies is playing the piano. I started taking piano lessons six years ago. I still take lessons and continue to hone my playing abilities. One more hobby of mine is reading. I like to read because it allows me to be immersed into another alternate reality where everything is different.
