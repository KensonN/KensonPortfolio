                At first, vacuum tubes were essential for computers. Vacuum tubes were tubes that could control the flow of electricity. They were about the size of a person's thumb. However, vacuum tubes were inefficient, required a lot of replacements, and needed a lot of space.

                Transistors

                This was when the transistor came to light. The transistor, which was a lot smaller, solved these problems. However, it created a new one: transistors needed to be soldered together, which meant that as computers became more complex, so did the soldering. Also, faulty transistors became hard to replace.

                        The integrated chip finally came to solve all the problems with vacuum tubes and transistors. Integrated chips were chips that had transistors pre-soldered onto it. This solved the problem of soldering individual transistors together.
