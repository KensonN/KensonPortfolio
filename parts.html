                Parts of a Computer
            </h1>
            <p>
                Today, computers consist of a lot of parts. Here, we will talk about each of the parts and their functions. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                Motherboard
            </h2>
            <p>

                The motherboard, otherwise called the mb, mainboard, or mobo, is a printed circuit board (PCB) that serves as the foundation of the computer. It is known as the foundation of the computer because it is how all of the other parts of a computer communicate with each other. Located on either the backside or the bottom of a computer, it holds many connections for other computer parts. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                CPU
            </h2>
            <p>
                <img src="http://www.custompc.ie/ekmps/shops/pctech/resources/Design/i7cpu1.png" width=300px  align="right"/>
                The CPU (central processing unit), also known as the processor, acts as the brain of the computer. A computer relies on the CPU. The CPU executes programs, by taking inputs and outputting the results to the other parts of the computer. Since CPUs are microprocessors, they are contained on an integrated circuit chip that is placed on the motherboard. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                RAM
            </h2>
            <p>

                RAM (random access memory) is where data that is being used by the computer can be kept. Accessing the RAM is a lot faster for a computer than hard drive. Because of this, a computer keeps data that is currently in use on its RAM. When the computer is turned off, the RAM is wiped. A good analogy for RAM is that RAM is like short term memory whereas the hard drive is long term memory. RAM is placed on the motherboard. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                Hard Drive
            </h2>
            <p>
                <img src="http://www.technomag.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hard-drive-2.png" width=400px align="right" />
                A computer's hard drive (HDD) is the data storage device of a computer. It has a one or more spinning disks with magnetic material. An actuator arm reads and writes data to the magnetic surface. This allows the computer to pull any data from the hard drive at any time. Unlike RAM, the data on a hard drive stays even when the computer is turned off. Because of this, the hard drive is like the long term memory of a computer. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                BUS
            </h2>
            <p>
                <img src="http://homework.uoregon.edu/pub/class/155/How%20Computers%20Work%20%5Bencyclopedia%5D_files/bus.gif" width=300px align="right" />
                In terms of a computer, a BUS is not a specific hardware component. Instead, it is simply the system of how a computer communicates between the individual components. When talking about the BUS, it covers all hardware components that transfer data, like wires, card slots, etc. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There are 2 types of BUSes in a computer: the internal bus and the external bus. The internal BUS connects the internal components of the computer together. For example, the internal BUS would connect the RAM to the motherboard.  The external BUS connects external components to a computer. For example, an external BUS can connect an iPhone or mouse to a computer.

            <h2>
                Keyboard
            </h2>
            <p>
                <img src="http://assets.razerzone.com/eeimages/products/76/razer-tron-keyboard-gallery-2.png" width=400px height=250px  align="right" />
                One of the input devices you can use is a keyboard. The layout of a keyboard looks very similar to a typewriter. The keyboard is the main input device of your computer, where you can type, play games, input commands, etc. Most of the time, a keyboard is bought as an accessory and commonly connected to a computer through a usb port.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Mouse
            </h2>
            <p>

                Another input device is the computer mouse. It acts as a way to control a pointer on a display, which allows the user to use their computer with ease. Like the keyboard, it is commonly connected through a USB port.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Monitor
            </h2>
            <p>

                The monitor is the visual display for a computer. The construction of the monitor usually includes a power supply, circuitry, a display device, and a casing for all of this. Today, most monitors contain either a liquid crystal display (LCD) or a light-emitting diode (LED) based display. Monitors are used by a user to see what they are doing on their computers software. There are many different types of connectors for monitors. However, the most common one today is via a HDMI port.
