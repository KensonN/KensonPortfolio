                What is Vindinium?
            </h1>
            <p>
                Vindinium is an AI programming challenge, where you must program an AI bot to beat the other bots in the game. To win, you must collect the most gold out of all 4 players of a game. For this project, we were provided with a modified version of the Node.js Vindinium starter pack. Node.js is a platform based on Javascript, which works best with networking. Because of prior usage of Javascript in the class and the need to send network request to the Vindiunium server, Node.js was the starter pack our whole class used. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This page will detail the code written which was not included in the starter pack. If you would like to see the starter pack, the link will be <a href= https://github.com/MattHesby/vindinium-js-starter style ="color: white;"> here</a>.

                            The first section of the code in the starter pack is the Global Data section. This is a section of my code where I define variables used throghout the code and create arrays that I used in the later tasks.

                            One of the first lines of the Global Data is defining variable "i". I define variable "i" because in all for loops used in my code, I always need to use "i".

                        I also created an array called "otherMines". This is an array to include all the mines on the map except for ones I currently own. To do this, I first set the array equal to the mines of the first player in the "enemyBots" array, an array created in the starter pack that contains all enemy players. Then, I concatentated the rest of the enemy mines and the unclaimed mines to the array.

                        The "closestEnemy" array is used to find the closest player to my bot, regardless of their amount of mines. To do this, I first created the array "closestEnemy", which I set equal to the first player in the "enemyBot" array. Then, using a for loop, I tested to see if my distance from the current "closestEnemy" was further than another player. If it was, then the "closestEnemy" was set equal to that new closer player.
